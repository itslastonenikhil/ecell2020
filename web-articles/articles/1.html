                    A generation that has been described as lazy, narcissistic, entitled and unable to stay in one job, have also been described as the most purpose driven and potentially the most entrepreneurial of all previous generations. Regardless of an individual's conditions, this generation has been generally influenced by an increase and fluency within communications, media, and technologies. Never has a generation been so aware of their options, thanks to the internet.

                    Gone are the days of businesses solely focusing on financial gains, as millennials believe that the success of a business should be measured on its impact on the world. It is about "balance," finding a gap in the market that is also fulfilling to the individual on a personal level.

                    In India a large number of technical institutions and institutions of higher learning have emerged since Independence. These institutions are churning out large number of trained manpower, thus fulfilling the need of the industry, R&D institutions and other economic sectors. In order to make favourable use of facilities, expertise and know-how available in these institutions for the benefit of the society, it is necessary that appropriate links are established between them and the industry. In addition, now-a-days young technocrats are also looking out for opportunities to exploit their full potential by setting up their own ventures thus becoming “job generators” rather than “job seekers”.

                    The National Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB) took up the scheme for establishment of Entrepreneurship Development Cells (EDCs) in academic institutions in 1986-87. Thereafter Entrepreneurship cell (E-CELL) has been established in many technical institutes and have taken up the role to blend technical inputs with entrepreneurial and managerial skills. The fact that the R&D of these technical institutions are involved in research in the industry, the output of this research can be translated into viable start-ups with the help of the E-cell. E-Cells are bridging the gap between the student community and the industry by guiding aspiring entrepreneurs and thus are an important part of every technical institution.
